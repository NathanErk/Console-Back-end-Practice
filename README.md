Console Back-end Practice is a open-sourced Code of mine that i made yesterday.
any user or Developer can check it out, use it for their own etc.

Although its messy, not organized, And very very amatuer. I think it will help a bunch of new Beginner Devs such as me learn Console,WriteLine(); functions.
Q/A:

1. What Language is this code written in?
- This Code is entirely made in C#
2. What application is this Code made in?
- Well it doesn't necessarily matter, in most but Visual Studio was used in this code creation.
3. What is the Target Audience?
- Beginner C# Programmers and Users who are naturally confused on how Console.WriteLine() and related functions work.

You might need extra outside help to get an extra better understanding in this Code, because there is no comments inside it.
