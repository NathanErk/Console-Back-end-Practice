Console Back-end Practice is a open-sourced Code of mine that i made yesterday.
any user or Developer can check it out, use it for their own etc.

Although its messy, not organized, And very very amatuer. I think it will help a bunch of new Beginner Devs such as me learn Console,WriteLine(); functions.
Q/A:
